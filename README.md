# CodeJamWinter2022

## Goal/Purpose
CodeJam for the New River Coding Club.  Will be similar to my final project for CSC221 in terms of format...uses streamlit and creates a UI that showcases a toolbox of things the user can interact with.

## Tools/Pages thus far
* Main/Home Page :house:
* Rock Paper Scissors Variants/Probability Lesson :scissors:
  * RPS 25
  * RPS 101
* Trivia game...currently does not prevent repeat questions :question:
* qrCode creator/attendance checker demonstration :raising_hand:
  * Would theoretically be used by teachers/professors to take attendance via students scanning QR Codes rather than calling role.
* Plan to add TypeSpeedTester :clock130:
